 * A term in the logical language.  You cannot extend this class
 * directly.  Instead, extend either Variable, BoundVariable, or
 * ComplexTerm.  A term is either a bound variable, a variable or a
 * complex term.  Functions and constants are complex terms as are
 * other terms such as class constructors.
