;;;First, something that has nothing to do with your question but
;;;will simplify notation.  You don't have to use cons or list* or
;;;backquote to prepend initial arguments for apply, because apply
;;;will do it for you.  I. e. instead of

;;;    (apply #'format `(nil ,@(beautify-plan1 plan)))

;;;you can use

;;;    (apply #'format nil (beautify-plan1 plan))

;;;OK, now for the more useful part.  First, an easy quick fix.

;;;    (let ((beaut (beautify-plan1 plan)))
;;;      (format nil "~?" (first beaut) (rest beaut)))

;;;If you're lucky, format will process this without ever using the
;;;call-arguments-limit mechanism, and you'll be able to use your
;;;existing code with virtually no changes.

;;;Here are some other things you might want to consider:

;;;It sounds like you are "flattening" your structure before you
;;;pass it to format.  This is probably not really necessary; you
;;;could probably get format to do what you want, without flattening
;;;the structure, by making use of the ~? and ~{~} directives.

;;;On the other hand, maybe you really want it flat.  In that case,
;;;consider this:

;;;    (apply #'format nil fmt args)

;;;is the same thing as

;;;    (with-output-to-string (s)
;;;      (apply #'format s fmt args))

;;;which is nearly the same thing as

;;;    (with-output-to-string (s)
;;;      (map nil
;;;           #'(lambda (f a) (apply #'format s f a))
;;;           fmt-list arg-list-list))

;;;where fmt-list is a list of substrings of fmt, and arg-list-list
;;;is a list of sublists of args, each having from 0 to 63 elements.

;;;Hope this helps.
