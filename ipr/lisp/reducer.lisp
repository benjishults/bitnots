;;; This file implements functions to rewrite formulas.  I think this
;;; just splits alpha formulas so that alpha-rules are applied without
;;; more nodes being added to the tree.  E.g., if a beta-rule
;;; introduces an alpha-formula, then that alpha-formula is split into
;;; its subformulas and those are put into the node created by the
;;; beta-rule.
