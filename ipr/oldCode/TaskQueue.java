/**
 * <p>A queue of Runnables.
 * 
 * <p>The contents of the queue are not serialized.
 * 
 * <p>This queue has a thread associated with it.  This thread
 * continually dequeues and dispatches tasks.
 * 
 * <p>This will need methods to allow the elements to be rearranged.
 * 
 * <p>This provides a way of putting "blocking tasks" anywhere on the
 * queue.  When a blocking task is reached by the dispatch thread, the
 * thread will block until some other thread sets the onHold property
 * of the TaskQueue to false.  If the onHold property is set to false
 * when a blocking task is at the front of the queue, the blocking
 * task will be removed from the queue.
 * 
 * <p>This does not allow two blocking tasks to occur next to each
 * other in the queue under any circumstances.
 * 
 * <p>This is a source of UnexpectedExceptionEvents.  These are thrown
 * when a Runnable on the queue throws an exception other than an
 * InterruptedException.  If a client wants to be notified of this
 * event, it should register an UnexpectedExceptionListener.
