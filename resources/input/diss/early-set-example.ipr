Subject: some theorems proved by the use of definitions and previously known theorems

Woody,

Below I demonstrate some things that my prover has done.  I realize
that this is still some simple "mathematics" but I do not consider
myself to have really accomplished anything great yet.  I only want to
let you know that I am making progress.

See what the prover (IPR) can do now: The user can load a group of
axioms, definitions and theorems (presumably the theorems will have
been previously proved).  Then the user enters a new theorem and the
prover (IPR) uses the knowledge as needed to prove the new theorem.

Here is an example:

First the user loads the following definitions and axioms:

(In my set theory 'an-element and 'a-member-of are undefinied.  The
prover has the axiom schema of "comprehension" or "classification"
wired in so that it can deal with 'the-class-of-all.  I call these
schema "church-schema" and "class-schema".  Both are used in the
proofs.)

(def-term (the-universe-class)
  (the-class-of-all (x) (= x x))
  (theory my-set-theory))

(def-term (the-empty-set)
  (the-class-of-all (x) (not (= x x)))
  (theory my-set-theory))

(def-predicate (a-set a)		; Suppes/Fraenkel
  (for-some ((x) (y)) 
    (or (and (a-member-of x a) (a-member-of a y))
	(= a (the-empty-set)))))

(def-predicate (an-ur-element a)
  (and (an-element a) (not (a-set a))))

(def-axiom an-element
  (forall ((x) (y))
    (implies (a-member-of x y)
      (an-element x))))

(def-axiom a-class
  (forall ((y) (z))
    (implies (or (a-set y) (a-member-of z y))
      (a-class y))))

(def-predicate (a-proper-class a)
  (not (an-element a)))

(def-axiom large-base
  (a-proper-class (the-class-of-all (p) (an-ur-element p))))

(def-axiom extensionality
  (forall ((x) (y))
    (implies (and (a-class x) (a-class y))
      (iff (forall ((u)) (iff (a-member-of u x)
			      (a-member-of u y)))
	   (= x y))))
  (theory my-set-theory))

(def-term (the-singleton a)
  (the-class-of-all (x) (= x a))
  (theory my-set-theory))

(def-term (the-pair a b)
  (the-class-of-all (x) (or (= x a) (= x b)))
  (theory my-set-theory))

Actually, some of the axioms and definitions are transformed into
several theorems in the knowledge-base.  Specifically, the above puts
19 theorems into the knowledge-base.  I admit that this is a small
number.  The computer finds the following proofs completely
automatically.  Of course, these are fairly simple theorems but I
think this shows that my ideas have potential.  Notice that each proof
is "the shortest possible" given the knowledge.  Also, this is only a
taste of what it will be capable of when I improve equality.  I
consider Boyer's challenge, which we discussed earlier and I am
working toward, to be quite possible.  In fact, I think the prover
will be even more capable.

The proofs are of the form ((*rule* &rest args) ... )
If a rule splits the proof then the subproofs are given in a list
below the rule which caused the split. As in:
((*splitting-rule* args) (*subproof1* *subproof2*))

I will let you know as the prover improves.

Here are some theorems it proves given the above knowledge.  Notice
that a lot of the knowledge is irrelevant but the prover is not
bothered by this.
